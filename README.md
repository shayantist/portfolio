# Portfolio 2020

My very own personal site/portfolio built with `React.js`/`Next.js` and `TypeScript`! The design is heavily inspired by a real designer: [Sean Halpin](seanhalpin.design), who you should totally check out!

Been super cathartic to work on this little side project that _doesn't_ have dire consequences if I don't finish it on time. On top of that, it's been a great learning experience to pick up `Next.js` and experiment with UI design and `CSS` using `styled-components`.

One thing I'm really proud of is making all the site content editable from a single [content.ts](./src/content.ts) file without having to touch the rest of the code. Could be useful to anyone interested in forking this ;)

To-Do:

- Set up Flask server with next for ML demo (docker + nginx)
- Clean up duplicate CSS across pages (`styled-components` is wonderful for this!)
- Convert `content.ts` to `content.json` to make more flexible
- Add sitemap for `robots.txt`
