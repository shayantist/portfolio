    "Hey there! I'm Shayan, a student and researcher at **Columbia University**, a climate policy leader with former **US Vice President Al Gore's Climate Reality Project**, and the Founder & Executive Director of **Reach4Help**, coordinating disaster response efforts for the most remote and vulnerable communities of the world. Since 2020, we've been supporting **10K+ NGOs and charitable organizations** respond to local crises—from running food distribution campaigns across 38 countries during the COVID-19 pandemic, to raising over €170K for medical supplies for Ukraine with the **World Economic Forum's Global Shapers**, to serving over 60K households affected by the recent floods in Bangladesh and Pakistan.  \nFor my work, I've been honored to be invited to speak at **Google**, the **UN Headquarters**, the **International Youth Conference**, and events hosted by the **World Economic Forum**. Previously, I worked as **data analyst** in Bangladesh with the **Ministry of Health**, analyzing COVID-19 data to inform governmental policy on lockdowns, resource allocation, and public health communications—and have co-authored several research publications on our work. Prior to that, I've been fortunate to develop my skills in research and data science at the **NY Genome Center, Google and Nobel laureate Joachim Frank's lab**.  \nWhile I'm not juggling being a student, leading an NGO and doing AI research, I love playing guitar, [browsing Reddit](https://redd.it/hp9wwp) and sleeping.
