    "***\"No one is useless in this world who lightens the burdens of another.\"*** -Charles Dickens  \nThat quote means a lot to me.

That's how what keeps me going every morning.  \nOutside of work, I'm a **CS student** at **Columbia University** in New York City! Recently, I've also gotten the chance to **travel** around, from **Scotland** to **California**, and have been *trying* to post about my experiences on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/shayan.tist/) so feel free to check that out if interested!  \nWhile I'm not juggling being a student, head of an NGO and researcher, I love playing guitar, [browsing Reddit](https://redd.it/hp9wwp) and sleeping.",
